// steam.h: Steam launcher module discovery API. Title Maker's
// "Import Steam Library" button (and any future caller) walks this
// to find every steamapps/ directory the user has on disk, then
// scans appmanifest_*.acf inside each to enumerate installed games.
//
// The Launcher struct's Claims/Build are registered separately via
// Launcher_RegisterSteam() in steam.cpp; these declarations expose
// the Steam-specific helpers that other modules (Title Maker, future
// first-run wizard) need.

// Path discovery returns count of resolved directories. Buffers are
// fixed-size to keep the API allocator-free; the cap is set by the
// module to a value generous enough for any sane Steam setup
// (multiple library drives, custom installs, Flatpak coexisting
// with native).

// Common Steam install locations across platforms. Includes the
// user-configured override from desktop.ini's [Desktop] SteamPath
// (passed in as `userOverride`, may be empty), plus Windows
// registry-detected install path on Win, Flatpak and Debian
// variants on Linux, etc. Each entry is the Steam *root* (the
// directory containing steamapps/), not steamapps/ itself.
//
// Returns the count written into `outRoots` (each a NUL-terminated
// path), capped at `maxRoots`.

// library folder Steam knows about (covers users with games
// installed on extra drives, e.g. D:\MikesSteamLibrary). Returns
// each library's *steamapps* dir, deduplicated. Append the root's
// own steamapps even if libraryfolders.vdf is missing/old, so a
// freshly-installed Steam with one library still works.
